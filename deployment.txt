OUTDATED!!!!!!! Needs update

In order to deploy the java-Code download ojbdc11.jar from this website: "https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/jdbc/218/ojdbc11.jar" (direct downloadlink)
If that doesn't work, try it from this link: "https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html".
Next download Intellij from the official Website and install it (students of the University of Vienna get the ultimate edition for free).
Then create a new java Project, got to File/Project Structure, choose Modules in the newly opened window, click the right plus-button, choose jars or directories, 
choose your downloaded ojbdc11.jar-file from your filesystem, click ok and/or apply adn close the window.
To create your tables, click on the Database button on the top right of the Intellij-window, click on the plus-button of the window, hover over Data Source 
and choose oracle on the popup menu. 

Enter the following connection-string (under URL) into the new window: "jdbc:oracle:thin:@domain:1521:orclcdb" 
(if you use a different oracle database use a different connection-string)

Enter your database-username and password, click on Test Connection and press apply and/or ok on success. If the test fails check your details and if you try to access 
the university-database outside the university network, check if you are connected with the BIG-IP Edge Client.

Then take all the files in the java folder and the sql-files and copy or transfer them into the src-folder of your Intellij-Project. Open the "create.sql" file,
select the dropdown menu of "<session>" and select your database > new session, execute all sql-queries by going into line 0, character 0, press the left play-button and 
choose the option that selects all queries and click it. Click the checkmark to commit the changes, go into the Main.java file and press the top right playbutton.
After the programm terminates, your java-code should be deployed


In order to deploy the php-Code, upload all the php-files to Almighty and put them in your account-folder in the directory "public_html". 
If the directory doesn't exist, create it. 
If you go to the website: "http://domain/~Youraccount/" 
you will be able to see that the website works, if you created and populated your database beforehand.


Inf you follow the instructions above successfully, the application will be deployed fully.
